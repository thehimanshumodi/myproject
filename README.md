This is a Django web application project. It includes two main apps: api, which likely handles the application's API endpoints, and base, which contains core models, views, and other business logic.

The project uses a SQLite database (db.sqlite3) for data storage by default.

The myproject directory contains the main Django project configuration files, including settings, URL routing, ASGI, and WSGI application entry points.

This project structure follows standard Django conventions and is ready for further development and deployment.
